# Realistic-MRI-CT-XCAT-Phantoms-for-Validating-MRI-Based-Deep-Learning-SynthCT-Methods
This project addresses the lack of high-quality paired datasets for multimodal deep learning in medical imaging by offering a synthetic yet realistic validation dataset. It bridges the gap between synthetic and clinical data, enabling more robust and meaningful evaluation of AI models for medical image synthesis.
