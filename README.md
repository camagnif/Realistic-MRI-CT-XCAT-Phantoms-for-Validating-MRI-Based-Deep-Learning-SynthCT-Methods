# Realistic-MRI-CT-XCAT-Phantoms-for-Validating-MRI-Based-Deep-Learning-SynthCT-Methods
This project addresses the lack of high-quality paired datasets for multimodal deep learning in medical imaging by offering a synthetic yet realistic validation dataset. It bridges the gap between synthetic and clinical data, enabling more robust and meaningful evaluation of AI models for medical image synthesis.

This is the code for the paper "Generation of multimodal realistic computational phantoms as a test-bed for validating Deep Learning-based cross-modality synthesis techniques" submitted to MBEC 2025.
